# AuctionHub E-commerce Web Application
An online auction is a virtual event where goods, services, and assets are offered to an individual who offers the highest amount of money for the item being sold. In the past, auctions were typically hosted as public events that were held in physical locations like town squares, courtyards, and houses where bidders would need to attend in person to participate in the bidding process. Both formats have their own advantages and disadvantages, but with the emergence of technology along with the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, online auctions have become increasingly popular, allowing bidders to participate from anywhere in the world. 
	It will be Team One’s goal to create its own version of an online auction system under the name “Auction Hub”. The proposed release date is April 2023 and will undergo rigorous planning and modifications throughout the upcoming month to ensure every functionality is implemented with a heavy focus on user experience.
